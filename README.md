# Lootlog

A news website for gaming and tech articles featuring a dashboard for users, authors and admins. Users can login and edit their details. Authors can write new articles and edit them before marking them as ready for review. Admins can review articles, publish and/or reject them as well as handle users, article categories etc.

## Notes

The frontend is (mostly) client-side only using Nginx as a proxy to communicate with the backend.
The project uses session based authentication with rolling tokens.
